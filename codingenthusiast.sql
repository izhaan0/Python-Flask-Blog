It is called a variable because the value may vary between data units in a population, and may change in value over time.\r\n\r\nFor example; \'income\' is a variable that can vary between data units in a population (i.e. the people or businesses being studied may not have the same incomes) and can also vary over time for each data unit (i.e. income can go up or down).', '', '2024-07-31 12:28:02.000000'),
(4, 'Keywords', 'Everything cleared about keywords', 'fourth-post', 'The objective of keyword research is to generate, with good precision and recall, a large number of terms that are highly relevant yet non-obvious to the given input keyword.[1] The process of keyword research involves brainstorming and the use of keyword research tools, with popular ones including Semrush and Google Trends. To achieve the best SEO results, it is important to optimize a website\'s content as well as backlinks for the most relevant keywords. It is good practice to search for related keywords that have low competition and still a high number of searches. This makes it easier to achieve a higher rank in search engines which usually results in higher web traffic and, ideally, conversions. The downside of this practice is that the website is optimized for alternative keywords instead of the main keyword; main keywords might be very difficult to rank due to high competition.[2] There are three essential concepts to consider when conducting keyword research. Good keywords are closely related to the subject of the website. Most search engines use an internal quality system to check website relevance related to possible keywords, a non-relevant keyword is unlikely to rank well for a website.[3] Good keywords that are highly competitive are less likely to rank at the top. Keywords that have no monthly searches are believed to generate little to no traffic and therefore of little value for SEO. Keyword stuffing on a web page should be avoided.', '', '2024-07-31 12:28:02.000000'),

Depending on the end consumer of these documents whitespace placement could be significant. One of the major niggles in Jinja2, in my opinion, is the way control statements and other elements affect whitespace output in the end documents.\r\n\r\nTo put it bluntly, mastering whitespaces in Jinja2 is the only way of making sure your templates generate text exactly the way you intended.\r\n\r\nNow we know the importance of the problem, time to understand where it originates, to do that weâ€™ll have a look at a lot of examples. Then we\'ll learn how we can control rendering whitespaces in Jinja2 templates.', '', '2024-07-31 12:30:01.000000'),

That energy is produced by having chemicals within the cell go through pathways, in other words, be converted. And the process of that conversion produces energy in the form of ATP, because the phosphate is a high-energy bond and provides energy for other reactions within the cell. So the mitochondria\'s purpose is to produce that energy. Some different cells have different amounts of mitochondria because they need more energy. So for example, the muscle has a lot of mitochondria, the liver does too, the kidney as well, and to a certain extent, the brain, which lives off of the energy those mitochondria produce.
